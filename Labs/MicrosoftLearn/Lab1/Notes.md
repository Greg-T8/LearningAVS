## Introduction

Azure VMware Solution is an Azure service that provides a vSphere-based, single-tenant private cloud. It runs on dedicated bare-metal infrastructure in Azure.

With this service, you can run, manage, and secure applications across VMware environments and Azure using a consistent operating model.

**Example scenario**  
You work for a healthcare company that hosts many production workloads on VMware vSphere across multiple offices.

Recently, several challenges have surfaced. Some locations have hardware nearing end of life, requiring urgent refresh decisions. At the same time, the company struggles to acquire new infrastructure quickly enough to meet refresh and application demands. The requisition process, approvals, and logistics can take four to six months or more.

To address these issues, the company is exploring migration of VMware vSphere workloads to the cloud, without changing the virtualization platform or altering current operations.
