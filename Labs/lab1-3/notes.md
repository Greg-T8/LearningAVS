## Introduction

The Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure is a set of documentation, guidance, best practices, and tools that help align business, organizational readiness, and technology strategies. It provides a clear, actionable path for moving to the cloud.

Cloud adoption changes how organizations acquire and use technology, offering greater flexibility in design and operations. The framework delivers a consistent, proven methodology to guide this transition.

It is built around eight methodologies:

* Strategy
* Plan
* Ready
* Migrate
* Innovate
* Govern
* Manage
* Secure

In this module, you will:

* Use the Cloud Adoption Framework to assess your environment and create a cloud adoption plan.
* Define your motivations for cloud adoption and set objectives to achieve your goals.
* Identify gaps in your strategy, such as missing technology, team training needs, or required organizational changes.

## Strategy

Use the Strategy methodology to build a clear plan for adopting and integrating cloud technologies. A cloud adoption strategy ensures alignment with business goals. The methodology includes five steps.

### Assess your strategy

* [Assess your cloud adoption strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/assessment)
* [Cloud Adoption Strategy Evaluator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/assessments/8fefc6d5-97ac-42b3-8e97-d82701e55bab/)

Evaluate your current cloud adoption strategy. Use the assessment results to show your organization’s cloud maturity, highlight gaps, and guide improvements.

### Determine your motivations, mission, and objectives

For a successful cloud adoption journey, start by clarifying your motivations for moving to the cloud. Common drivers include cost savings, agility, scalability, and innovation. Align your strategy with these motivations to better achieve business goals. For instance, if critical business events are a priority, you may need to begin migration early, alongside strategy and planning.

Define a clear mission and objectives to provide direction and purpose. A mission has value only if it leads to action, measurable outcomes, and effective achievement of objectives. Write a mission statement that connects your objectives and key results to your organization’s broader business mission.

Break your mission into actionable steps—these become your objectives. For each objective, define measurable KPIs to track progress. Assign accountability for every key result, and review them regularly with their associated KPIs. A strong mission with well-defined objectives keeps your team focused and motivated throughout the cloud adoption journey.

### Define your team

* [Define your cloud strategy team](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/define-your-team)
* [Recommended functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/define-your-team#recommended-functions)
* [Seek input](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/define-your-team#seek-input)

The cloud strategy team ensures alignment between business goals and adoption efforts. Assign each member a role that adds value to cloud adoption. For example, a lead architect can translate business objectives into technical designs, while a compliance team ensures practices meet regulatory requirements.

To maintain alignment, the team should regularly seek input from other business areas, such as HR or marketing. Start with a small core team including IT, finance, and security, then expand as adoption grows. Review team composition often to maintain diverse representation and identify risks and opportunities. Begin with an initial strategy built by the core team, then broaden it as executive support increases.

### Prepare your organization

* [Prepare for organizational alignment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/prepare-organizational-alignment)
* [Leadership buy-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/prepare-organizational-alignment#leadership-and-executive-buy-in)
* [Understand your organization's capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/prepare-organizational-alignment#understand-your-operating-models-readiness-for-cloud)
* [Transition from project model to delivery model](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/prepare-organizational-alignment#shift-from-a-project-model-to-product-model)

Organizational alignment ensures leadership collectively supports your cloud adoption strategy. Start by engaging a few key stakeholders, then expand leadership buy-in as you refine implementation. Leadership must consistently support your vision and strategy.

Alignment across business, digital, IT, and adoption strategies is also critical. If these strategies already exist, make sure your adoption strategy supports their goals. Regularly check in with business, digital, and IT leaders to keep cloud initiatives aligned with changing objectives.

Assess your current capabilities across people, processes, technology, and partners. Review your operating model and identify gaps in culture, roles, skills, or support. Your adoption strategy should account for the resources needed to close those gaps.

To achieve scalability and speed, your organization may need to shift from a project delivery model to a product delivery model. This means moving away from task-based projects with fixed scopes and timelines to a continuous, outcome-driven approach managed by cross-functional teams responsible for development, operations, and governance.

### Inform your strategy

* [Develop a cloud adoption strategy](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/strategy/#cloud-adoption-strategy-checklist)

After completing the first four steps, consider the following factors to refine your cloud adoption strategy:

**Financial efficiency:** Make strategic choices to maximize value from your investment and reduce unnecessary costs.

**AI:** Integrate AI into your cloud platform to leverage analytics, machine learning, and automation for optimized operations and business growth.

**Resiliency:** Build your cloud infrastructure for resiliency to reduce the impact of disruptions and maintain reliable operations.

**Security:** Start security discussions early, adopt a Zero Trust approach, and explore Microsoft-led workshops to modernize practices.

**Sustainability:** Incorporate sustainability into your strategy to improve operations and strengthen your organization’s reputation.
